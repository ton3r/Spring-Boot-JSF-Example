Spring-Boot-JSF-Example
=======================

Fork of Zergleb's Spring Boot + JSF Integration, forked from cenobyte321/Spring-Boot-JSF-Example 

# Problem get solved if you set <tomcat.version>8.5.11</tomcat.version to your pom.xml properties section. Then it runs also with Spring-Boot-1.5.6.RELEASE

https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/10232

# This is a demonstration that there is probably a _bug/error/feature/_ during the creation of an executable .war file with spring-boot-maven-plugin since Version >= 1.5.3.RELEASE

Build it with

```
mvn clean install spring-boot:repackage
```

and try to execute it with

```
java -jar target/application-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war
```

You will get during startup an Exception like this :

```
2017-09-08 10:48:23.860  INFO 35369 --- [ost-startStop-1] j.e.resource.webcontainer.jsf.config     : Mojarra 2.2.7 ( 20140610-1547 https://svn.java.net/svn/mojarra~svn/tags/2.2.7@13362) f√ºr Kontext '' wird initialisiert.

2017-09-08 10:48:27.938 ERROR 35369 --- [ost-startStop-1] j.e.resource.webcontainer.jsf.config     : Critical error during deployment: 

com.sun.faces.config.ConfigurationException: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: javax.faces.FacesException: java.io.FileNotFoundException: JAR entry META-INF/ not found in /var/folders/gj/...
```

Changing spring-boot-parent version in pom to something lower 1.5.3.RELEASE it works fine.

## Note from original

There was a common belief that because JSF and Spring MVC were their own view technologies and that they could not be used together, but this is incorrect and is part of this example.
